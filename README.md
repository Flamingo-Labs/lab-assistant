# The Lab Assistant
A Discord bot for the Flamingo Labs Discord server.

Initially is going to be used to host an XP system to give us an incentive to work on our projects
and contributing to the group.

It will initially be hosted on [https://la.taxborn.com](https://la.taxborn.com), however eventually will move to
the eventual flamingo labs domain, at [https://api.flamingolabs.software/lab-assistant/](https://api.flamingolabs.software/lab-assistant/)
*(actual domain tbd)*.

# XP System
Since the Lab only has a handful of people, it should be easy to host the database of this on my server in SQLite.

## Scoring System - subject to change
- 1 commit to your repository - **1 XP**
- 1 commit to someone else's repository - **2 XP**
- 1 merged PR to someone else's repository - **5 XP**
